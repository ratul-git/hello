      <h1>About Cricket</h1>
      <p>
       <blockquote><mark>Cricket</mark> is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven
        players on a field at the centre of which is a <pre>22-yard (20-metre) pitch</pre>
        with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three
        stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one
        of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while
        the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the
        ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and
        dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include
        being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and
        by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the
        bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball
        before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten
        batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.
        The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and
        match referee in international matches. They communicate with two
        off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</blockquote>
